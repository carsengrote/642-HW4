Trace 3

Traceroute attempts to construct the exact routing path a packet takes to reach a machine connected to the internet.  It does so
by initially sending a UDP packet with a ttl of 1 hop, and listening for the time exceeded response from the last router that the 
packet arrived at before exceeding it's number of hops.  The ttl is increased by 1 hop each time which fingerprints the path of routers
that the packet takes to get to the destination.  Once the ttl is large enough such that the destination IP is reached, the port 
unreachable message is sent back, indicating the packet made it to the destination.  Replies to the sender are sent via ICMP protocol.
